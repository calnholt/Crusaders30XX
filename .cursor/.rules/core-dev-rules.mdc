#STRICT RULES

##CODING STANDARDS

- When making new systems, always add the appropriate DebugEditable and DebugTab attributes.
- Use imports, do not reference like this: "Crusaders30XX.ECS.Data.Cards".
- Prioritize readability over complexity - if it's more lines but easier to follow, that's good.
