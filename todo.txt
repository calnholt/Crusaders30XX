fixes - 

enemy death animation

victory animation

modal / pay cost close buttons

enemy attack is occuring when battle is over

card tooltip hover creates tooltips for those cards - prevent

update starting deck

infernal execution broken - confirm button now showing; make new system for confirm button (and update how it looks - same look to End Turn)

ambush meter needs parallax and timer text in the center

visual cue for cards that can't be played

secondary font

action point tooltip showing when display is not showing

when hovering over cards, have enemy attack meter show what it would look like if you added the card a block - requires second progress component

remove context id from enemy attack progress

decouple tooltip from UIElement; make it a separate component

enemy attack display - update text for different types of conditinos (one card, tow cards, etc)
"if this attack (deals damage, is not blocked by X cards) - [effect]"

card idea - spend aegis

cards level up - playing them grants +X exp and finishing a quest gives them all +Y exp; need to figure out smart way of implementing upgraded version

cancel button in pay cost overlay doest work with mouse; X is not positoined correctly

card hand hitbox is wonky

defile and tarnish effects (enemy attacks that mutate blocked cards - exhaust on next block / use)

on hit - exhaust top card of player's deck

on hit - top card gains burn 1

on hit - card becomes colorless
