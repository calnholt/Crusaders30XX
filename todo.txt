I want to improve the logic for automatically paying card costs based on hand composiition. When deciding whether to pay cost, we should determine if we can automatically deduce which cards to discard based on the contents of the player's hand. For example, for Narrow Gate (cost White, Any, Any), if the player has three cards in their hand and one, two, or ALL are white, the card should automatically be played. The pay cost overlay should display when the situation is ambiguous. In the narrow gate example, if the player had four cards in hand, we would want the overlay to show because we dont know which cards he wants to select. Any questions?

I want implement a quest rewards. For right now, the only reward from a quest is Gold, as indicated in @save_file.json and @desert.json. Upon completing a quest, the @QuestRewardModalDisplaySystem.cs should display the type of reward and the amount. Upon completeing and while saving, we want to adjust the @save_file.json to gain the reward. Playing an old quest does NOT grant these rewards again. So we can use the save_file.json completed flag to check if reward should be given.  Any questions?

In LocationScene, add a CurrencyDisplaySystem that will render the player's current gold. We will use a customizable trapezoid from @PrimitiveTextureFactory.cs (adding all necessary debug fields) as the backgorund, and then display the gold total with @gold.png to the right. Add debug fields for margin, padding, text scale, gold coin size, etc. Any questions?

Modify @TooltipQuestDisplaySystem.cs to show the rewards of a quest. This section will be below the tribulations section, using another divider, this time with the treasure_chest.png instead of the chalice.png. Let's center the rewards in the section, with {number} and {symbol}, with currently gold be the only type. Create appropriate debug attribute fields. Any questions?

I want to create a new PoisonSystem. I want it to subscribe to AppliedPassive Event and listen explicitly for when the player is poisoned. When condition is met, find the entity "UI_PassiveTooltip_{key.ownerId}_{key.type}" from @AppliedPassiveDisplaySystem.cs to position a very small meter below it. The background of the meter is black, the meter fill is red. When the player is poisoned, every 60 seconds the player loses 1HP (send ModifyHpRequestEvent) and then the 60 second timer resets. The red meter fill corresponds to how much time is left from the meter. Create an entity and transform for this meter and position using the transform and the UI_PassiveTooltip_ as the anchor. Create appropriate bbug attribute fields to adjust apearance. Any questions?

I want to update @BattlePhaseDisplaySystem.cs for the animation with text and trapezoid, right now the trapezoid shape is showing for EVERY phase change. I only want it to show for the phases we show the text for - Start of Battle, Block Phase, Action Phase. Any questions?
