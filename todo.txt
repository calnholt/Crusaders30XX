Generate shield shader and helper; create shield display system that keys off existence of having shield passive.

When cards are assigned as block, instead of showing the card name as tooltip, change it to be TooltipType = Card with the card's id as the id, and show tooltip below. Any quetions?

I want to create a generic enemy attack named Glass Cannon. It's text will read "If this is blocked with exactly one card, this attack deals no damage and the blocking card is exhausted." I will need to implement the actual logic for this, and the most difficult area will be in @EnemyAttackProgressManagementSystem.cs, which keeps a running struct of data for a given enemy attack. That system right now only applies rules logic and no special enemy attack logic. So let's say Glass Cannon has a damage value of 8. If the player doesnt block, they take 8 damage. If the player blocks with one card, the EnemyAttackProgressManagementSystem should update so that actual is 0. If the player blocks with 2 cards, it should do the normal blocking calculation. Does that make sense? It might be a good idea to create a Service for handling this that can be keyed off with attack id. The second part of this is that if one card is used to block, when the player confirms blocks and the assigned block cards usually move from AssignedBlock zone to Discard zone, the one card needs to go to Exhaust zone instead. It's important to note that blocking with equipment against Glass Cannon DOES NOT COUNT as a card for this condition, therefore it would reduce the damage of the enemy attack as per usual. Any questions on either part of this?

I want to create a QuitCurrentQuestDisplaySystem. The goal of this system is that when you press the back button on a controller or the ESC key on keyboard, a black transparent overlay appears with white text centered in the screen that reads "Abandon quest?" Position the text with an entity and transform. Attach a HotKey component to it with the key = back (or if keyboard, ESC). Pressing back when the overlay is active makes it fade out and go away. The parent for the hotkey component should be an offscreen UIElement that when executed performs a TransitionEvent to Location Scene using UIElementEventDelegateService - create a new type AbandonQuest. Make sure the parent UIElement is off screen. Create debug attributes for customizing text scale, overlay transparency, etc. Fields for fading lengths. When the overlay is not visible i do not want to see the hotkey button displayed. Any questions?
