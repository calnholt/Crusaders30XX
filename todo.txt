I want to improve the logic for automatically paying card costs based on hand composiition. When deciding whether to pay cost, we should determine if we can automatically deduce which cards to discard based on the contents of the player's hand. For example, for Narrow Gate (cost White, Any, Any), if the player has three cards in their hand and one, two, or ALL are white, the card should automatically be played and all three cards in hand be discard. The pay cost overlay should display when there can be more than one discard configuration. Order is NOT important (discarding card A, then B, then C is the same as discarding C, then A, then B)! In the narrow gate example, if the player had four cards in hand, we would want the overlay to show because we dont know which cards he wants to select. Any questions?

I want implement a quest rewards. For right now, the only reward from a quest is Gold, as indicated in @save_file.json and @desert.json. Upon completing a quest, the @QuestRewardModalDisplaySystem.cs should display the type of reward and the amount. Upon completeing and while saving, we want to adjust the @save_file.json to gain the reward. Playing an old quest does NOT grant these rewards again. So we can use the save_file.json completed flag to check if reward should be given. Currently @QuestRewardModalDisplaySystem.cs is not displaying when the quest is finsihed (although the button to proceed works by pressing the HotKey button). Any questions?

In LocationScene, add a CurrencyDisplaySystem that will render the player's current gold. We will use a customizable trapezoid from @PrimitiveTextureFactory.cs (adding all necessary debug fields) as the backgorund, and then display the gold total with @gold.png to the right. Add debug fields for margin, padding, text scale, gold coin size, etc. Any questions?

Modify @TooltipQuestDisplaySystem.cs to show the rewards of a quest. This section will be below the tribulations section, using another divider, this time with the treasure_chest.png instead of the chalice.png. Let's center the rewards in the section, with {number} and {symbol}, with currently gold be the only type. Create appropriate debug attribute fields. Any questions?

I want to create a new PoisonSystem. I want it to subscribe to AppliedPassive Event and listen explicitly for when the player is poisoned. When condition is met, find the entity "UI_PassiveTooltip_{key.ownerId}_{key.type}" from @AppliedPassiveDisplaySystem.cs to position a very small meter below it. The background of the meter is black, the meter fill is red. When the player is poisoned, every 60 seconds the player loses 1HP (send ModifyHpRequestEvent) and then the 60 second timer resets. The red meter fill corresponds to how much time is left from the meter. Create an entity and transform for this meter and position using the transform and the UI_PassiveTooltip_ as the anchor. Create appropriate bbug attribute fields to adjust apearance. Any questions?

I want to update @BattlePhaseDisplaySystem.cs for the animation with text and trapezoid, right now the trapezoid shape is showing for EVERY phase change. I only want it to show for the phases we show the text for - Start of Battle, Block Phase, Action Phase. Any questions?

I want to update @HellriftIndicatorDisplaySystem.cs so that we scale the indicator icon - not the V arrow - relative to the distance to the Hellrift, the further away the smaller. Create a debug field scale mult for this.

I want to create a HintTooltipDisplaySystem at @Game1.cs level. When using a gamepad and hovering = true over UIElement and pressing the Left Stick Button and the entity has new Hint component attached to it, display a tooltip like message to the player relative to where the entity is positioned based on its transform. Hint component will have a text field that we will display. I want the hint tooltip to be a white bubble with black text, and I want to position @guardian_angel.png on the outside bottom right of it, to make it look like the guardian angel is talking. The purpose of this system is to give the player an easy way to get information about GUI options as if Guardian Angel is talking. This helps her feel more like character and gives basic tutorial things more personality. The text should wrap within the white bubble. Add debug attribute fields to control display. This tooltip should be an entity positioned using a Transform. Does not need a UIElement. Any questions?

I want to fix an issue with the @DebugMenuSystem.cs. When toggling it off with (shift + d), it covers other UIElements, preventing interaction. When this modal is closed I want to make sure the UIElement doesnt prevent clicks from behind. Perhaps we delete the entity on close? It's okay to take the performance hit since it's not a production feature. Any questions?

I want to create a JigglePulseDisplaySystem at @Game1.cs level. The goal of this system is to subscribe to JigglePulseEvent which has an entity to be jiggled and a JigglePulseConfig with: PulseDurationSeconds, PulseScaleAmplitude, JiggleDegrees, PulseFrequencyHz settings (like from @MedalDisplaySystem.cs and @TribulationDisplaySystem.cs). This system should then perform the jiggle pulse animation given the values from this config. Then remove the jiggle pulse code from @MedalDisplaySystem.cs and @TribulationDisplaySystem.cs and have them send JigglePulse events instead. Any questions?

I want to create a new system CardTooltipDisplaySystem.cs which will display a card rendered from @CardDisplaySystem.cs as the tooltip. Create a new component CardTooltip that has CardId: string, where CardId is the card to display as a tooltip. Use the OnCardRenderScaledEvent for displaying. We will only display the tooltip when the entity has a UIElement where hovered = true and also has CardTooltip component. The first use case is that 'pouch_of_kunai' card entities need to have CardTooltip attached with CardId = 'kunai'. This will be data driven as @pouch_of_kunai.json has cardTooltip field. Need to update CardDefinition and check for field in @EntityFactory.cs when creating cards. Create debug fields to customize the size of the tooltip, as well as gap, etc. Any questions?

I want to create a QuitCurrentQuestDisplaySystem. The goal of this system is that when you hold down the back button on a controller or the ESC key on keyboard, a black transparent overly appears with white text centered in the screen that reads "Abandon quest?" Position the text with an entity and transform. Attach a HotKey component to with the key = back (or if keyboard, ESC). The parent for the hotkey component sohuld be an offscreen UIElement that when executed performs a TransitionEvent to Location Scene. Make sure the parent UIElement is off screen. Create debug attributes for customizing text scale, overlay transparency, etc. This overlay should fade in back button is pressed and fade out when stopped being pressed. Fields for fading lengths. Any questions?
