# Crusaders30XX Card Power Rankings

## Valuation Framework

### Core Principles
- **Player HP = 20**, enemy attacks deal 8-25 damage/turn
- **Block > equivalent damage** (blocking 3 prevents more % of enemy output than 3 damage does to enemy HP pools of 50-150)
- **1 AP per turn** - free actions are extremely valuable
- **Draw is very valuable** - more options = better decisions
- **Quest bonuses** - moderate value, compound over run but battles won on immediate effects

### Value Benchmarks
| Resource | Approximate Value |
|----------|------------------|
| 1 Damage | 1.0 |
| 1 Block | 1.3-1.5 (worth more than damage) |
| 1 Aegis | 1.5-2.0 (any-source prevention) |
| 1 Draw | 5-6 (very valuable per design) |
| 1 Courage | 3-4 (unlocks powerful cards) |
| 1 Power | 4-5 (battle-long, multiplies per hit) |
| 1 Aggression | 1.0 (turn-only, consumed) |
| 1 AP gained | 12-15 (doubles your turn) |
| Free Action | ~1.5x multiplier on card value |
| 1 Card Discard Cost | -6 to -8 (losing block + potential) |
| 1 Penance | -3 to -4 (damage penalty + scar risk) |

### Baseline Card: Strike
- 12 damage, 3 block, 50% for 2 courage, 1 AP, 0 cost
- Total value: ~12 + 4 + 1 = **17 value for 1 AP**
- This is the "average" card baseline

## Power Rankings (1-5 Scale)

**Rating Scale:**
- **5** = Meta-defining, auto-include, enables strategies
- **4** = Very strong, high priority, efficient
- **3** = Solid, does its job, good in right deck
- **2** = Below average, situational, needs synergy
- **1** = Weak, generally avoided

---

### TIER 5 (Meta-Defining)

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Shroud of Turin** | 5.0 | Copy ANY hand card, free action, +1 temperance, exhausts. Doubles your best card each battle. Insane flexibility - can copy your finisher, your draw, your defense. The best card in the game. |

---

### TIER 4 (Very Strong)

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Serpent Crush** | 4.5 | 12 damage + draw 1 + gain 1 AP, all FREE. The AP gain essentially gives you a second turn. 4 courage requirement is steep but the payoff is enormous. Build-around payoff card. |
| **Impale** | 4.0 | 15 free damage for 2 courage is excellent efficiency. In courage builds, this is your bread and butter damage dealer. |
| **Stab** | 4.0 | 10 free damage for 1 courage. Most accessible of the courage-spend attacks. Great in any deck that generates courage. |
| **Vindicate** | 4.0 | Up to 45 damage (25 base + 20 at 5+ courage). THE finisher for courage builds. Losing all courage is fine when the enemy is dead. |
| **Increase Faith** | 4.0 | +3 Power for FREE. Power persists all battle, so in a 5-turn fight this is +15 total damage across attacks. Scales harder the longer battles go. |
| **Burn** | 4.0 | 4 burn DoT is solid, but the real value is at 3+ courage: GAIN 1 AP. AP generation is incredibly rare and powerful. |
| **Dowse with Holy Water** | 4.0 | +5 aggression (or +15 at 5+ courage) for free. Combined with Fury (double aggression), this enables massive single-attack bursts. Key combo enabler. |
| **Shield of Faith** | 4.0 | 9 aegis for 1 card discard. That's 45% of your HP protected. In a game where block > damage, this is premium defense. |
| **Bulwark** | 4.0 | 6 damage + 3 block as a FREE action. The quest +1 block compounds nicely. Reliable, efficient, always useful. |

---

### TIER 3.5 (Strong)

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Sacrifice** | 3.5 | Draw 2 for free is amazing (10-12 value). The +1 penance is a real cost (-3 to -4) but draw is so valuable it's usually worth it. Don't spam it. |
| **Divine Protection** | 3.5 | 4 aegis free action. Solid defensive option, no downsides. Not flashy but always useful. |
| **Fury** | 3.5 | Double aggression for free. With Dowse (15 aggression at 5 courage), Fury makes it 30. Combo piece - weak alone, devastating with setup. |
| **Deus Vult** | 3.5 | Free action, +1 courage, damage scales with courage (3 + 2x). Requires weapon attack first. Great in weapon builds, mediocre without. |
| **Stalwart** | 3.5 | 7 block is massive (highest in game). The -2 courage hurts courage builds, but pure defense decks love this. |
| **Carve** | 3.5 | 10 damage with +5 quest scaling. 50% shuffle back gives value over time. Solid mid-tier attack. |
| **Ravage** | 3.5 | 25 damage for just 1 card discard is efficient. Mill 4 can be downside in thin decks but usually fine. Best cost-to-damage ratio. |
| **Reap** | 3.5 | 25 + 5 per red discarded. In red-heavy decks, this hits 30-35. Good in color-focused builds. |
| **Tempest** | 3.5 | 15 damage + 3 temperance for 1 white. Temperance triggers equipment abilities. Strong in temperance/equipment builds. |
| **Whirlwind** | 3.5 | 16 damage (8x2) for 1 black card. Multi-hit scales with Power - with +3 Power becomes 22 damage. Good for managing enemy threat with multiple hits. |
| **Sword** | 3.5 | 17 damage weapon + 1 courage. Costs 2 cards which hurts. But weapons are always accessible and enable Deus Vult. |
| **Razor Storm** | 3.5 | 3 hits x 1 damage base, but each hit scales with Power. With +3 Power (Increase Faith), becomes 3x4 = 12 free damage. Excellent Power scaling makes this a sleeper pick in Power-stacking builds. Also helps manage enemy threat with multiple hits. |

---

### TIER 3 (Solid)

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Strike** | 3.0 | The baseline. 12 damage, 3 block, 50% for 2 courage. Reliable, no conditions, always playable. Not exciting but never bad. |
| **Seize** | 3.0 | 6 base damage is weak, but +10 when courage was lost this phase makes it 16. Pairs well with Stab/Impale. Needs synergy. |
| **Hold the Line** | 3.0 | Draw 1 on block. In a game where draw is valuable, getting a card for blocking is nice incremental value. |
| **Anoint the Sick** | 3.0 | Heal 4 HP free action. With 20 HP, that's 20% recovery. Solid sustain option. |
| **Heaven's Glory** | 3.0 | Free +1 inferno +1 burn to enemy. Inferno creates more burn over time. Good in DoT builds. |
| **Courageous** | 3.0 | +3 courage for free, but ENDS YOUR TURN. Great turn 1 setup, terrible mid-combat. Very polarizing. |
| **Pouch of Kunai** | 3.0 | Creates 2-4 kunai (4 damage free attacks each). Average 3 kunai = 12 free damage. Costs 1 AP + 1 white card. Value varies with RNG. |
| **Narrow Gate** | 3.0 | 25 damage + 6 aegis is strong, but 3 card cost + 1 penance is steep. Powerful but inefficient. |
| **Purge** | 3.0 | 35 damage is huge, but 3 card cost means you're spending 4 cards total. Quest bonus helps but still expensive. |
| **Reconciled** | 3.0 | 25 damage (40 at 0 scars/penance) for 2 red cards. Conditional bonus is unreliable late-run. |
| **Mace** | 3.0 | 4 damage + 1 power, weapon, costs 1 red. Power gain is nice but damage is low and cost hurts. |
| **Ark of the Covenant** | 3.0 | 1 block is low, but heals 3 when discarded for cost. In weapon builds using Sword (Black+Any cost), you're discarding every turn - Ark provides consistent sustain. "Always online" in the right deck. |

---

### TIER 2 (Below Average)

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Dagger** | 2.5 | 5 damage weapon for 2 courage. Low damage, no block, courage cost. Enables Deus Vult but weak on its own. |

---

## Archetype Synergies

### Courage Build
**Core:** Courageous, Stab, Impale, Serpent Crush, Vindicate
**Support:** Deus Vult, Seize, Sword, Burn
**Strategy:** Build to 4-5 courage, unleash Serpent Crush (refunds AP) or Vindicate (45 damage finisher)

### Aggression Burst
**Core:** Dowse with Holy Water, Fury, any big attack
**Support:** Increase Faith (power), high-damage finishers
**Strategy:** Dowse (+15 at 5 courage) → Fury (double to 30) → big attack for massive single hit

### Weapon Synergy
**Core:** Sword, Dagger, Mace, Deus Vult
**Support:** Courage generators
**Strategy:** Weapons always accessible. Play weapon → Deus Vult scales with courage

### DoT/Burn
**Core:** Burn, Heaven's Glory
**Support:** Sustain cards (Anoint, Divine Protection)
**Strategy:** Stack burn/inferno, survive while DoT kills enemy

### Temperance/Equipment
**Core:** Tempest, Sacrifice, white block cards
**Support:** Equipment with temperance abilities
**Strategy:** Build temperance through blocking/cards, trigger equipment abilities

### Power Stacking
**Core:** Increase Faith, Razor Storm, Whirlwind, Mace
**Support:** Any multi-hit effects, long battles
**Strategy:** Stack Power early (Increase Faith, Mace), then multi-hit cards scale damage. Power persists all battle so benefits compound.

### Weapon/Sustain
**Core:** Sword, Ark of the Covenant, Deus Vult
**Support:** Courage generators, healing
**Strategy:** Sword costs 2 cards, so Ark triggers every turn for +3 healing. Sustained damage + sustain.

## Quick Reference Rankings

| Rating | Cards |
|--------|-------|
| **5** | Shroud of Turin |
| **4-4.5** | Serpent Crush, Impale, Stab, Vindicate, Increase Faith, Burn, Dowse with Holy Water, Shield of Faith, Bulwark |

## Notes for Balance Consideration

1. **Shroud of Turin** is significantly above curve - copying cards is inherently broken
2. **Courage build** has the highest ceiling (Serpent Crush AP refund is unique)
3. **Aggression burst** (Dowse + Fury) can one-shot enemies but requires setup
4. **Penance cards** (Sacrifice, Narrow Gate) have hidden long-term costs
5. **Free actions** are generally stronger than AP-cost equivalents
6. **Costed cards** (2-3 discards) struggle to justify their cost except for finishers
7. **Power + multi-hit** is a strong synergy - Increase Faith + Razor Storm/Whirlwind scale well
8. **Dagger** is the weakest weapon - consider damage increase or lower courage cost

---

## Key Synergy: Power + Multi-Hit

Power applies to EACH hit of multi-hit attacks:

| Card | Base | +3 Power | +6 Power |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| Razor Storm (3 hits) | 3 | 12 | 21 |
| Whirlwind (2 hits) | 16 | 22 | 28 |

This makes Increase Faith (+3 Power free) extremely valuable when combined with multi-hit cards.
