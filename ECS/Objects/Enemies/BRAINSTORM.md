# Enemy Brainstorm

## Fire Theme

### Overheat
"If you blocked with 3+ cards last turn, this attack deals +X damage."

Creates pressure to "run cool" - don't over-commit blocks. Changes how many cards you play defensively.

### Ignition
"On reveal: Your burn triggers again immediately."

Creates urgency to heal *before* this attack appears, not after. Changes turn sequencing and when you prioritize healing.

### Flashpoint
"Deals damage equal to cards in your hand."

Creates dump-your-hand pressure. Conflicts with saving cards for later turns.

### Slow Burn
"If you didn't deal damage last turn, +X damage/effect."

Punishes pure defense turns. Forces aggression even when you want to turtle.

### Thermal Momentum
"If you fully blocked this enemy last turn, +X damage/effect."

Punishes playing too safe. Eventually you MUST let some damage through.

### Scorched
"Red and white cards block for half value but gain double courage/temperance."

Trade-off, not just a penalty. You might want to block with those cards for the passive gain even though they're worse blockers. Changes card evaluation.

### Fury (tracking mechanic)
Enemy gains Fury for each card the player plays. Effect TBD.

Creates tension around playing lots of cards - big combo turns have a cost.

### Burn-to-Power (kernel)
You gain power (or some benefit) equal to burn damage you take each turn.

Burn becomes fuel. Changes whether you want to heal or ride the burn for value.

### Backdraft
"If you have X+ cards in hand, Y."

Threshold-based hand size punishment. Simpler than scaling - creates a clear "dump below X" pressure point. Player knows exactly when they're safe vs in danger.

### Doused
"Deals X damage, -1 for each burn stack on you."

Burn becomes armor against this attack. Creates tension: do you heal the burn (and take more from this), or ride the burn for protection? Inverts the usual "burn is bad" assumption.

### Spreading Flames
"This attack gains +1 damage for each card that blocks it."

Punishes over-blocking. Throwing multiple small cards at it makes it worse. Forces commitment to a single big blocker or accepting damage.

### Smolder
"At the start of action phase, gain 1 Smolder. At 3 Smolder: take 1 damage, reset to 0."

Inevitable ticking clock that doesn't interact with blocking at all. Slow, steady pressure - every 3 turns you take 1 unavoidable damage. Creates background urgency to end the fight.

## Darkness Theme

### Hesitation
"Your first attack each turn deals half damage."

Blunts your opening strike. Changes attack sequencing - do you throw away a weak attack first to "clear" the debuff, or accept reduced damage on your big hit? Makes attack order matter.

### Nightmare (Card)
"2 Block. Exhaust on play or block. If [hyper-conditional], gain [strong effect]."

Deck pollution that isn't pure dead weight. It's a bad card - 2 block is weak, and it clogs your draws. But it exhausts when used, so it cycles out. The hyper-conditional upside creates a mini-game: do you hold it hoping to hit the condition, or just dump it for 2 block and move on?

### Leech
"Heals equal to damage dealt."

Simple sustain threat. Chip damage now extends the fight - every point you let through undoes your progress. Full blocks matter more. Changes the "let 2 through" calculus.

## Petrify (Medusa Theme)

### Core Mechanic
**Petrified** cards:
- Cannot be played
- Cannot be pledged
- CAN block
- Persists across battles until freed

### Crack System
Petrified cards have 0-3 cracks. **Cracks only accumulate while the card is in hand:**
- +1 crack when this card is used to block
- +1 crack for each card you play (applies to ALL petrified cards in hand)
- At 3 cracks: remove Petrified, card is freed

### Key Interactions
| Interaction | Ruling |
|-------------|--------|
| Multiple petrified cards in hand | All gain +1 crack per card played |
| Freed mid-block | Completes block normally, goes to discard freed |
| Pledged cards | Cannot become petrified (immune) |
| Stacking (Frozen, Shackled) | Can stack - card can be Petrified AND Frozen |
| Forced exhaust/discard | Can target petrified cards; stays petrified in exhaust pile |
| In draw/discard pile | Stays petrified, but no crack accumulation |

### Why It's Interesting
- **Not fully dead**: Can still block, which chips away at the curse
- **Activity = freedom**: Aggressive play breaks stone faster; turtling stays cursed
- **Draw matters**: Must actually draw the card to make progress
- **Quest persistence**: Medusa leaves her mark - you walk away cursed
- **Discard tension**: Discarding petrified card pauses progress
- **Exhaust = disaster**: Petrified card in exhaust pile is nearly unfreeable

### Medusa Attack Concepts
- **Gaze** (4 dmg): On hit, petrify 1 random card from hand
- **Stone Stare** (6 dmg): On reveal, petrify top card of draw pile (buried, unknown)
- **Basilisk Glare** (3+3 dmg): Two-hit. On hit, shuffle a petrified card from hand into draw pile (delays progress)
- **Serpent Strike** (7 dmg): On hit, all petrified cards lose 1 crack (undoes progress)
